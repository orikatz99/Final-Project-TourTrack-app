## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📱 Running the Android App

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/orikatz99/Final-Project-TourTrack-app.git
   ```
2. Open the `app/` folder in **Android Studio**
3. Make sure your emulator or device is connected
4. Sync Gradle and run the app

> **Note:**  
> The file `google_maps_api.xml` is required for map functionality and is ignored in Git.  
> Make sure to add your own **Google Maps API key** inside `app/src/main/res/values/google_maps_api.xml`:
> ```xml
> <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">YOUR_KEY_HERE</string>
> ```

### 🌐 Backend Hosting

The backend server is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and is automatically available via: "https://tourtrack.vercel.app/"
>  The app is already configured to use this backend via Retrofit,  
> so no changes to the API base URL are required.
